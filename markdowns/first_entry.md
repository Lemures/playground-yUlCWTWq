#The First Entry
#### And hopefully more to follow.

So lately I've been using the Rust playground a lot to play and experiment with new concepts that I've been learning about. Via from the Book or from other rustiancs blog post. For a while I've just been save the code into a rust file, which is all great and all but mearly a unorginzed reference. To ease some of that I try to make the code readable be it variable with meaningful names and comments. But i've been looking for a better way to store these snippets of knowledge that felt more orginized.

So my chooses for this code journal that I've been wanting to put together are plentiful. but didn't want to create a blog, least not in the tradition sence. Structer is important and while blog are great for sharing content with others, they can get difficaut to navigate as they scale up. 

Also I'm not a blogger, never been one and not sure if I could ever be that good at it. That said I this idea of a keeping a journal does leave the possiblity that an entry could a great topic for a blog post. however my focus will be first and foremost an structured place for me or maybe others to fall back on as a reference.

So now that I've ranted on why I'm not just making a wordpress. I can consider my next option or rather why not this is not my choose. So Rust being a modern Language offers great tool more spacificaly i'm talking about `cargo doc`. As i was writing this I though to my self why not just make a new Lib with modules for each new snippet. While at that moment I though this was a eureka moment, it really wasn't least not for what i wanted. It's purpose is really for document functions. My plans are more about showing demos and breaking them down line by line.
